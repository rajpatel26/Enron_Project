# Enron_Project
A famous Enron dataset containing a collection of Emails exchanged by employees of the Enron corporation.
This dataset became a public record following a high-profile investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC), which resulted in several Enron's top executives being prosecuted for fraud, and the company going bankrupt (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal for more details).

Aim was to understand the graph theory by implementing simple network analysis of the above use case.
1) Basic Network Extraction
2) Creating a Weighted Network
3) Computing Basic Degree Statistics (in_degrees & out_degrees)
4) Computing Degree Distributions (in_degrees & out_degrees)

Tools used were Apache Spark integrated with Jupyter Notebook and functions written in Python.
